# Welcome to the AND!XOR LULZCODE Atom Package. #

Ensure your serial device is set properly e.g., /dev/ttyUSB0 in settings.

## Requirements ##

Currently this plugin only works on Linux OS. Windows, even with WSL does not
play nice with commandline YMODEM tools.

This package requires a local copy of `sz`. It can be installed with
```
sudo apt-get install lrzsz
```

## Developer Mode ##

To upload a file, the badge must first be put into developer mode. During startup,
hold the DOWN button when the eye stops flashing until the screen turns red.

The badge is now in developer mode. Open the LULZCODE file you wish to upload and run.
Then click the emoji toolbar icon. If the toolbar is missing or the emoji is missing
press Ctrl + Alt + L to active it.
